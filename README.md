## Homework 1

    This program takes a csv file of data for people
    and creates objects from the data of people and 
    saves the data into a pickle file

    You can run this program by running
    python3 filename.py data/data.csv in terminal
    because it needs to know where to get the data from
    
    The advantages of using text processing in python
    is the libaries in python like NLTK and other AI/ML
    libraries in python. The distadvtanges would be for
    this kind of problem the run time in python would be
    more than most other languages.
    
    Throughout this assignment it gave me a refresher 
    on regex. I already worked with system arguments,
    dictionaries, lists and working with files in the past.
    I learned how to store object data into a pickle files
    and load them from a pickle file.
